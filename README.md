# Movie-Recommendation

This program uses spaCy to calculate the semantic similarity between a Hulk movie description and a list of movie 
descriptions stored in a text file. The program reads in the movie descriptions from the text file, calculates the similarity 
scores using spaCy's similarity function, and stores the scores in a dictionary with the movie titles as keys. 
The program then returns the title of the movie with the highest similarity score.
